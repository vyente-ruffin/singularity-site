# Development Rules

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

1. Write tests first before implementation
2. Red-Green-Refactor cycle
3. Maintain high test coverage

## Task Management

- All work items tracked in Azure DevOps
- Link commits to work items using AB#{id}
- Update work item status when completing tasks

## Code Quality

- Run linting before commits
- Follow project style guides
- Document public APIs and components

## Git Workflow

- Feature branches from main
- Pull requests for all changes
- Squash merge to main
